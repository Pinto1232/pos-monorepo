# Testing Navbar Customization Auto-Apply Changes

## Changes Made

1. Added `useCustomization` import to the UI Navbar component
2. Added customization context to the UI Navbar component
3. Updated the AppBar component to use the customization context for its background color
4. Removed the hardcoded background color from the Navbar.module.css file

## How to Test

1. Open the application and navigate to any page with the main UI Navbar (not the dashboard)
2. Open the settings modal (usually accessible from the user menu or settings icon)
3. Go to the "General Settings" section
4. Change the navbar color
5. Click the "Save" button
6. Verify that:
   - The modal closes
   - The navbar background color changes immediately without a page reload
   - No browser refresh occurs

## Expected Behavior

- The navbar should update with the new color immediately after clicking "Save"
- The page should not reload (URL should not change, no flicker of the page)
- The changes should persist if you navigate to different pages or reopen the settings modal

## Technical Implementation

The changes work by:
1. Using the CustomizationContext to access the current customization settings
2. Applying the navbar color directly to the AppBar component using the `sx` prop
3. Removing the hardcoded background color from the CSS to allow the dynamic color to take effect
4. Relying on React's state updates to trigger re-renders when the customization context changes

This approach ensures that all components using the customization context will automatically update when changes are made, without requiring a page reload.
