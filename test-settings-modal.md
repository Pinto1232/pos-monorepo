# Testing SettingsModal Auto-Apply Changes

## Changes Made

1. Added `useQueryClient` import from '@tanstack/react-query'
2. Added queryClient instance to the SettingsModal component
3. Modified the `handleSave` function to:
   - Remove the `window.location.reload()` call
   - Update the customization context directly via `onCustomizationUpdated`
   - Invalidate the React Query cache for both 'userCustomization' and 'customization' query keys
   - Close the modal without reloading the page

## How to Test

1. Open the application and navigate to the dashboard
2. Click on the settings icon to open the SettingsModal
3. Go to the "General Settings" section
4. Change the sidebar color or navbar color
5. Click the "Save" button
6. Verify that:
   - The modal closes
   - The changes are applied immediately to the sidebar/navbar without a page reload
   - No browser refresh occurs

## Expected Behavior

- The sidebar and navbar should update with the new colors immediately after clicking "Save"
- The page should not reload (URL should not change, no flicker of the page)
- The changes should persist if you reopen the settings modal

## Technical Implementation

The changes work by:
1. Using React Query's cache invalidation to trigger a refetch of the customization data
2. Updating the CustomizationContext directly via the `onCustomizationUpdated` callback
3. Components that use the CustomizationContext will automatically re-render with the new values

This approach is more efficient than reloading the entire page and provides a better user experience.
