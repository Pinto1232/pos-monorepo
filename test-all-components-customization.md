# Testing Automatic Customization Updates for All Components

## Components Updated

1. **Sidebar Navbar** (`frontend\src\components\sidebar\Navbar.tsx`)
   - Already using customization context correctly
   - Uses `customization?.navbarColor || '#173a79'` for background color

2. **UI Navbar** (`frontend\src\components\ui\navbar\Navbar.tsx`)
   - Added `useCustomization` import
   - Added customization context to component state
   - Updated AppBar to use `customization?.navbarColor || '#1e3a8a'` for background color
   - Removed hardcoded background color from CSS module

3. **Footer** (`frontend\src\components\footer\Footer.tsx`)
   - Added `useCustomization` import
   - Added customization context to component state
   - Updated Box and footer elements to use `customization?.navbarColor || '#111'` for background color
   - Removed hardcoded background color from CSS module

4. **SettingsModal** (`frontend\src\SettingsModal.tsx`)
   - Already updated to use React Query's cache invalidation
   - Removed page reload (`window.location.reload()`)
   - Updates customization context directly
   - Invalidates React Query cache for both 'userCustomization' and 'customization' query keys

## How to Test

1. Open the application
2. Navigate to a page that shows all components (main page with navbar and footer)
3. Open the settings modal (usually accessible from the user menu or settings icon)
4. Go to the "General Settings" section
5. Change the navbar color
6. Click the "Save" button
7. Verify that:
   - The modal closes
   - All components (both navbars and footer) update with the new color immediately
   - No browser refresh occurs

## Expected Behavior

- All components should update with the new color immediately after clicking "Save"
- The page should not reload (URL should not change, no flicker of the page)
- The changes should persist if you navigate to different pages or reopen the settings modal

## Technical Implementation

The changes work by:
1. Using the CustomizationContext to access the current customization settings in all components
2. Applying the navbar color directly to components using inline styles or the `sx` prop
3. Removing hardcoded background colors from CSS to allow the dynamic colors to take effect
4. Using React Query's cache invalidation to trigger refetches of customization data
5. Relying on React's state updates to trigger re-renders when the customization context changes

This approach ensures that all components using the customization context will automatically update when changes are made, without requiring a page reload.
